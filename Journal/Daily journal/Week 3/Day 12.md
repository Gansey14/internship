This log is connected to the [[Learning objective 5]]

**The goals for today:**
- Make a linkedin post about the internship
- Have a meeting with Frederike
- Lunch
- All UX teams meeting
- Document the process
- Make a sitemap

The absolute most useful thing from today was that I need to learn and fiddle more in Figma. I learned how much I do not yet :D I made a presentation tho about my table component and they liked it :) Now I need to document it in a short guide and then in Figma file which I will link.

We were also talking how are we going to make the shared design system which would have similar naming conventions for pages so all devs would have a similar experience. (Include Read me for example). We were also talking about how to implement an icon system using a Google sheets import for faster process.
