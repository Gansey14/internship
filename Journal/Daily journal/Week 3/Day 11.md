This log is connected to the [[Learning objective 3]]

In the morning I was mostly preparing for the interviews which I am going to have so I made different versions. Then I had a internal stakeholder meeting with Biljana. She introduced me to the software and gave me a general idea about how is the handover going to look like. 

After that I had a first user interview with Sidsel which I documented in interview questions for [[My questions for users]]
