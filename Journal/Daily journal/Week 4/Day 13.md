This log is connected to the [[Learning objective 1]] and [[Learning objective 2]]

I had a half an hour interview with Valentin where we discussed our current performance but mainly my learning objectives and how can we reach them together. That was actually really nice because I got a short look into how do they adjust their file structure in Figma and also just small things like file cover to show what type of project it is. 

Later I looked into different date pickers and I made a mistake of sticking to their current system instead of suggesting a completely new solution. I stayed a bit closed minded but Valenting recommended me to use the google analytics one and maybe we can [combine](https://www.figma.com/design/51yD196oN31j42ASgv5lY2/Filters-in-Order-Portal?node-id=204-26528&t=az6IlTfVJzYHjMfm-11) the current system with the new approach.
