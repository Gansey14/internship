I spent the morning finishing up the design of the filters and making the design file optimized. The main difference from my work in school is that prepared my file for three stakeholders:
- One for internal feedback within the design team - showing all the thinking process and reasoning behind my decisions based on the research
- One for the most important research and that being the visit in the distribution centers. I wanted to have some screens ready for explaining some features if necessary such as the date picker
- One for the developers with all the states and scenarious of the UI elements

I had a short feedback session from Daniel and he mentioned that he trust my process and that I should focus on having the questions ready for the important interview.

After that I was trying to reach the correct people from the finance and logistics department because they are using the solution as well based on the feedback from the product owner Maria.
