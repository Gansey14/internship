We got our first task which was connected to make better documentation for the company for collecting visual elements and comparing competitors. We were suppose to focus on individual components, pages and flows:

- Components
    - Carousels
    - Navigation
    - Favourites
    - Special offers
    - Recommended accessories
    - Filtering
    - Inspiration
- Pages
    - PDP - Product display page
    - PLP - Product listing page
    - Favourites
    - Blogs
- Flows of pages
    - Before shopping
    - During shopping
        - Site search
    - Check out flow
        - Click and collect
    - Ordered
        - Delivery
        - Order tracking
    - Post purchase care

We were than suppose to go through the list of competitors which was provided to us:

Put an image from the presentation

I also included some of the competitors which I perceive as relevant based on countries:

- Denmark
    - Drommeland
    - Kvik
    - Beliani


Interesting thing was that he made us focus on only four things:

- Baymard institute
	- For fact checking because they did a lot of research
- Eagle
	- To gather the visuals
- Figjam
	- To document the details 
- Bookmarks / Alfred
	- The bookmarks can be opened all at once when they are shared

What do they want to know about the customers?

- What is the age range of our users?  
- Why JYSK > competitors  
- Which products are the most viewed (but never bought)?  
- How many people add enough to their basket to receive free delivery  
- What is the most used search pathway (search - navigation - home page)?  
- Do userâ€™s come back to the product they were looking at before?  
- How important / effective are the discounts/deals on products?
