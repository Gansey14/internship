In the morning there was a birthday breakfast of Laura who just turned 30. That was pretty nice I got to talk to John for a bit about music. After that I shortly prepared for the meeting with Maria who is a product owner of the order portal. That went really well. She answered all my questions. 

After lunch we got a introduction to the current design system in JYSK. In the end I got to build my own design system combined with the JYSK design system. I used a plugin for importing the relevant styles for spacing, font sizing, and all of the other details. Cool thing about this is that it is connected to the variables which are set automatically so I do not need to spend a lot of time on it. After that I imported color styles from JYSK library and I also used components from the same place. I tested it out on building navigation and it was working pretty nice so far.
