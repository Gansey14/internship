First I had to go through my email, accept meeting invites and view my board for the order portal. Then I will plan my day to include the first kick off task but also to start on my internship relevant task connected to order portal.

I think I will first spent an hour on finishing of the kick off task for the pages so I will research the favourites page, take notes from that and document everything in bookmarks and eagle.

I am writing the text below after the day ended:
In the end I managed to do what I wrote here initially. After lunch I focused more on learning about the order portal using confluence documentation and I had to submit a ticket in order for me to see the order portal prod and dev environment. I wrote down bunch of questions which I asked Valentin and after I scheduled meetings for a proper introduction with an order portal team. 

In the end of the day I focused more on helping out Lasse with a design challenge. I could not get the image to resize responsively so it was a challenge.
