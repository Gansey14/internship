I want to learn to create clear and scalable design handovers that align with the existing design system.

**What does that include?**
- Research how to do a proper handover on my own
	- Help devs understand the handover
	- Help users understand the changes
- Have a session with Emil about handovers
- Do a handover
- Get feedback for the handover from the developers AND user
