I want to learn to use an agile framework like Scrum to plan and manage design tasks within a cross-functional team.

**What does that include?**
- Learning about it from articles
- Learning about it from the team
- Comparing it
- Being part of the ceremonies
- See what is better? Show how can I contribute or suggest improvements? How would I use it on my own? Would I even use it on my own? If yes, when?
