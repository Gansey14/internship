I want to learn to design efficient, user-friendly interfaces by implementing features like shortcuts, filters, and smart search.

**What does that include?**
- Research about efficiency and factors come in to that role?
- How did I focused and applied these effieciency factors?
- Did I use the mentioned features? If yes or no, why?
	- What is good about them? Are users used to them?
- Can efficient and userfriendly be combined?
