I want to involve internal users in the design process through research methods like interviews, usability testing and analytics analysis.

**What does that include?**
- Interviews
	- Define types of target audiences
	- Interview them in Head Office and in Distribution center
- Testing
	- Think aloud testing - maybe online
- Analytics
	- Implement analytics
		- Ask biljana
	- Analyse the data
