I want to create and/or contribute to a shared Figma design system using components, variables, and tokens.

**What does that include?**
- Creating a design system from scratch and explaining why I did certain stuff?
- When are the individual types useful?
- Was it worth the work?
- Was there any feedback from Valentin or Daniel?
	- Think about dimensions
