Notes:
- Interviewee: Sidsel (E-commerce and sales)
- Usage: 2x/week
- About sales team:
	- They are used to shortcuts in Excel
	- Each filtering and searching for an order is unique -> cant generalise
- Main task: Looks at payments
	- This task is not possible in the BI
- Issues: 
	- Order count is not showing larger number than 10 000
	- When there are two delivery options they can not filter
		- They need it. They get samples and it would be nice to get a bit of accuracy
	- Missing filter min and max value of the order
	- Searching for a country is not possibly from filters
	- Date picker
		- Should not refresh on each day, month and year
		- Freezes when typing in the date
- Improvements:
	- When there are two delivery options they can not filter
	- Choose all button in filters is missing 
	- Grouping of filter methods
	- Expanding filters move the content -> Makes you lose track of the order
	- Search for EAN number (all the orders which include a spec. product)
	- shows total value of orders which are listed (Is in WSS)
	- Export data to Excel
	- Handover
