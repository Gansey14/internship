Based on a book: Jobs to be done by Intercome
and my brainstorm
#### Context & Workflow
- Can you walk me through a typical day using the order portal?
- At what point in your workflow do you usually turn to the portal?
- What other tools or processes do you use alongside it?

#### The Job-to-be-Done
- When you use the portal, what job are you trying to get done?
- What’s the most important outcome you need from it (speed, accuracy, visibility, etc.)?
	- Are you using shortcuts in other programs?
- If the portal disappeared tomorrow, how would you get your job done?

#### Struggling Moments & Pain Points
- What parts of the order process feel slow, frustrating, or confusing?
- Have you ever had to switch back to email, spreadsheets, or another workaround instead of the portal? Why?
- Are there steps where you feel you’re adding information without adding value (a “meaningless step”)?

#### Adoption & Switching (Optional)
- How was the transition from your old system (WSS, email, spreadsheets, etc.) to the portal?
- Were there any anxieties or concerns when you first started using it?
- What keeps you from going back to old methods?

#### Desired Outcomes & Improvements
- If the portal worked perfectly, what would that look like for you?
- What’s one thing you wish the portal did better?
- Are there parts of your workflow we *shouldn’t* try to solve with the portal?

#### Examples & Stories
- Can you tell me about the last time you were frustrated using the portal? What happened?
- Can you tell me about the last time the portal really helped you do your job better?
- Has a customer ever noticed or been affected by how you used the portal?

#### Feedback & Iteration
- How do you currently share feedback about the portal?
- Do you feel your suggestions are being acted on?
- What would make it easier for you to give feedback in the future?
- Can we stay in touch directly?

#### Filter Questions
- Do you need to see your filters all the time, or only when changing them?  
- Do you often adjust filters, or mostly keep the same setup?  
- Would preset date ranges (e.g. “last 7 days”) help you?  
- Is the country filter clear, given there’s already a top selector?  
- Are any filter dropdowns confusing or unclear?  
- Which search/filter do you use most often?  
- Is there a filter you wish existed but isn’t here yet?  

#### Handover Questions
- How do you prefer to hear about design changes (email, chat, meeting)?  
- How often would you like updates on changes?
