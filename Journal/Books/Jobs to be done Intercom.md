- Four forces
	- The push of what is happening currently: “This mattress is pretty uncomfortable. I’m waking up multiple times in the night with back pain.”
	- The pull of a new solution: “If I get a new mattress, I can sleep better. I’ll be in a better mood at home and at work.”
	- The anxiety of what could happen: “What if the new mattress turns out to be just as bad as the old one? I can only try it out for a few moments in the store.”
	- The attachment to what you currently have: “I’ve had this mattress since college.”
- Buying process
	- Once you figured out you wanted to buy a new solution, did you do much research to figure out which tool was right for your company?
	- Were you the only one who was looking for something else at that time? · Where did you first hear about the tool you picked?
	- Can you recall how you came to purchase the specific tool you did?
	- When you were looking around, did you (or anyone else) try out any other tools? What were they?
	- How long did you look around before you clicked “buy” on the website?
- Helping people switch:
	- Advertising lets you manipulate these four forces. Specifically you can: 
		1. Increase the push away: Show how bad their existing product really is. 
		2. Increase your product magnetism: Promote how well your product solves their problems. 
		3. Decrease the fear and uncertainty of change: Assure consumers switching is quick and easy. 
		4. Decrease their attachment to the status quo: Remove consumers’ irrational attachment to their current situation.
- Understanding the full process
	- You can focus on the most concise, painful subset your product solves, or alternatively the piece you can make more fun or interesting
- A worse product can do a better job
- Job stories
	- [ When _____ ] [ I want to _____ ] [so I can _____ ] “When ____” focuses on the situation, “I want to ____” focuses on the motivation, and “so I can ____” focuses on the outcome.
	- Here’s one approach: 
		1. Start with the high level job. 
		2. Identify smaller jobs that help resolve the high level job. 
		3. Observe how people solve the problem now (the job they currently use). 
		4. Come up with a Job Story to investigate the causality, anxieties and motivations of what they do now. 
		5. Create a solution which resolves that Job Story

- The productive layers of conversation
	1. The immediate layer relates to usefulness. What do you actually do with the thing? I use the drill to make holes. 
	2. The secondary layer relates to usability. What result comes from using it? I’ve made holes to hang photos. 
	3. The tertiary layer relates to desirability. What’s different now that I’ve accomplished my goal? I’ve hung photos and now have a more personal home.
