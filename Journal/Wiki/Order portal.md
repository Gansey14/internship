**Overall tips**
- Look at google sheets

**Tasks made by me:**
- Create a sitemap of the order portal (Pages)
	- Include popups (actions)
	- Include basic flow of information
- Figure out what are some of the most important jobs to be done here?
	- Include in the interview or/and ask the business person
	- List of JTBD:
		- CRUD
			- Create
				- offer
				- order
			- View an order
			- Edit an order
			- Delete an order
		- Create new customer
- Maybe: Suggest tooltips or use guiding elements based on the intro videos


**Questions for Valentin:**
- - Is the order portal only for B2B customers?
- Do you think it would be a good idea to start with building a sitemap and then JTBD?
- Is the CMD view part of the order portal?
	- MHOE - Ask about the customer data software in the POS system
		- It is [CMD application](https://jysk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/B2Bdep/pages/412516944/CMD+basic) and that is a separate software from Order portal
- What are articles -> https://jysk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/B2Bdep/pages/200376409/Order+Portal+basic#Add-articles-and-prices
- Who should I invite for the first introduction meeting? Biljana Gajer?
- Is there some sort of analytics setup?

- Do you think that we will go to Uldum right after the intro meeting?

**Question for developers:**
- What tech stack are they using?

**How to create a good ticket?**
- Ask Emil and Mette for Jira

**Competitors to research:**
- Jira 
- Monday 
- Google sheets
- Shopify - headless (Simplicity)  

**What questions should I ask during the first meetings?**
- Who do I interview after you?
- What are the other tools you considered to solve this issue?
